# Booking System – Phase 2  
Onyeisi Chidiebere, Abara Callistus 

submission for Phase 2 of the Booking System project.  
The main system was built together with my group partner Callistus   

Link to the original code we worked on:  
https://github.com/callistus0/CybersecurityAndDataPrivacyAutumn2025/tree/main/BookingSystem/Phase1/Part2

The application runs perfectly and includes:
- User registration and login  
- Booking and viewing appointments  
- Basic security (password hashing, protected routes)  
- Basic privacy features (consent + logging)

Everything works as demonstrated 

Thank you.
