## 6️⃣ ZAP Scan Findings (Round 2 Results)

### **Total Alerts: 1**

| Alert | Risk Level | Instances |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens | Low | 1 |

### 🔍 **Summary**
In Round 1, ZAP found several alerts:

## 7️⃣ Detailed Findings – Round 2

### ⚠ **Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens (Low)**  
- CSRF protection still not implemented.  
- This allows a possible Cross-Site Request Forgery risk.

  - Add CSRF token to forms  
  - Validate token server-side  

---

## 8️⃣ Conclusion  

The updated application in Phase 1 / Part 2 shows **significant improvements**:

- All **input validation issues are fixed**  
- Registration workflow behaves correctly  
- ZAP scan results improved from **4 medium alerts → 1 low alert**  
- Security posture is improved but **CSRF protection still missing**
